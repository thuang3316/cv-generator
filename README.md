# React-based Online CV Generator

This project uses React to build an online CV generator that allows users to generate a resume based on their personal information. (including general info, education, projects, work experience and skills)

I also add the download feature to this project using [html2pdf.js](https://github.com/eKoopmans/html2pdf.js). This way we can preserve the CSS styling of the resume when transforming it to pdf.

There is an example resume available. You can just click the 'Show example' button on the top right corner.

In the future, I might add more features that allow users to customize the resume and have more freedom designing the resume.
